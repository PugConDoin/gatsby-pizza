## View Your Gatsby Build

Go to Gatsby folder in terminal

> npm start

~/Documents/gatsby/slicks-pizza/gatsby î‚° npm start

> slicks-slices-frontend@0.1.0 start
> npm run develop

> slicks-slices-frontend@0.1.0 develop
> cross-env NODE_OPTIONS="-r esm" gatsby develop

After a short while we see a lot of success messages followed by a link to localhost to see slicks-slices-frontend in the browser: http://localhost:8000/

This will render index.js as the homepage.

We can also View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore the site data and schema: http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql
